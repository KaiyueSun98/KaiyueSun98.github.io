Coursework and Projects (Term Time)
--------
**2020** 

- Pattern Recognition Coursework: Face Recognition
  - intro 
- Final Year Project: Stochastic Relative Degree and Output Regulation of MIMO systems
  -  My final year project is about Control Engineering. The concept of stochastic relative degree is derived from relative degree for deterministic systems. Stochastic systems are defined by stochastic differential equations in which the drift and diffusion terms are linear function of the states and control inputs. Then, the output regulation problem for linear systems is reviewed. 
It is noticed that the solution for single-input single-output linear stochastic systems has many restrictions and can not generalise to all the classes of systems. Therefore, another method using the knowledge of stochastic relative degree is proposed. Mathematical analysis
and examples are provided to illustrate the method. Although it cannot solve the problem completely, it provides clue for the research in this area in the future.

- Digital System Design Coursework: 
  - Coursework Objectives: Accelerate intensive arithmetic applications in the meanwhile use the hardware resources effectively
  - What I did:
    - Designed a NIOS II processor on an FPGA using on-chip RAM using Quartus II software; 
    - Applied CORDIC algorithm using Verilog to improve accuracy; 
    - Designed specific floating-point arithmetic tools for the function to be evaluated, so ready-made but inefficient Altera floating-point tools were replaced.
  - Learning outcomes: 
    - Familiarised me with FPGAs, CUP architecture, Hardware/Software partitioning; 
    - Consolidated my hardware designing & Verilog skills;

- Deep Learning Coursework: 
  - The objective is to propose an image descriptor for measuring similarity between images. The descriptor is trained and tested on N-HPatches, a noisy version of HPatches dataset. The method of 2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pipeline is used in the baseline appraoch. The first network aims to denoise the input patches. The second one is used to train the descriptor, which is then evaluated on three tasks: patch verification, image matching and patch retrieval. 
  - Firstly, the baseline approach is demonstrated and implemented. Based on that, an improved approach is proposed and evaluated. 
  - Then an insightful aanalysis of the improvement upon the baseline approach is discussed in the final part.

- Formula Student Society Project:
  - I joined FS Electrical & Electronic Team at the beginning of the Year 3.

The document [TSAL Design](https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/KaiyueSun98.github.io/blob/main/TSAL%20Design.docx) extracted relevant design criteria from the rules and proposed the basic designing method by me. The document [TSAL Report](https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/KaiyueSun98.github.io/blob/main/TSAL%20Report.docx) was part of the final report and written by me as a summary of the TSAL design.
