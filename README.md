Coursework and Projects (Term Time)
--------
**2020** 

- Pattern Recognition Coursework: Face Recognition
  - intro 
- Final Year Project: Stochastic Relative Degree and Output Regulation of MIMO systems
  -  My final year project is about Control Engineering. The concept of stochastic relative degree is derived from relative degree for deterministic systems. Stochastic systems are defined by stochastic differential equations in which the drift and diffusion terms are linear function of the states and control inputs. Then, the output regulation problem for linear systems is reviewed. 
It is noticed that the solution for single-input single-output linear stochastic systems has many restrictions and can not generalise to all the classes of systems. Therefore, another method using the knowledge of stochastic relative degree is proposed. Mathematical analysis
and examples are provided to illustrate the method. Although it cannot solve the problem completely, it provides clue for the research in this area in the future.
