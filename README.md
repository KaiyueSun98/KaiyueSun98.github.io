Experience
---------
**Silicon Engineer, Radio Frequency Silicon Evaluation team at Mediatek UK Kent Design Centre.** (2019.4-2019.10)

- The key responsibility during the six-month internship in RFSE team was to carry out numerous chip evaluation tasks within the limited time budget. 
- Was trained to use professional test equipment and software of LabVIEW to automate the test process. 
- The tasks involved great amount of data processing using Excel macros, Python, and MATLAB to improve efficiency, which greatly developed my problem-solving ability and made me adapted to working under pressure.
